Today, Michael and I had a pretty intense discussion about some recent events and our working relationship. Here are the key points I remember:

We started by addressing the incident during the team call. I felt overshadowed by Michael's comments, which I perceived as negative and humiliating. Michael explained that his intention was to challenge the group constructively, not to single me out. He apologized for any hurt caused, which I appreciated, though it didn't entirely alleviate my frustration. Michael said something like, "I apologize, but I want to challenge the team to think forward."

We then moved on to our communication styles. I expressed that Michael's approach often feels dismissive and confrontational. Michael apologized and clarified that his comments are meant to be constructive. It was good to hear his perspective, but I couldn't help feeling a bit annoyed that this keeps happening. I told Michael, "You need to stop interrupting. Your behavior with interruptions is making me feel very unhappy."

The conversation touched on the broader team dynamics. I shared my concerns about the team environment feeling toxic at times and how I believe Michael's behavior contributes to this atmosphere. Michael was surprised and emphasized his intention to be supportive. It was a relief to know that he wants to contribute positively to the team, but I still felt a bit skeptical.

We also discussed our focus on functional requirements over strategic thinking. I raised concerns about this, and Michael acknowledged the importance of strategic considerations but stressed the need to prioritize current business requirements. It was a balanced discussion, and I felt heard, though I still worry about our long-term direction.

I mentioned that the current work allocation might be hindering productivity. Michael explained the challenges we face and we discussed potential solutions to improve workflow and collaboration. It was a constructive conversation, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we keep running into the same issues.

Throughout our discussion, Michael apologized multiple times and even suggested aligning me with another team if the current environment isn't working for me. I appreciated his willingness to find a resolution and his apologies, but I remain concerned about the overall team dynamics and communication.

Overall, it was a productive conversation, and I feel hopeful about improving our working relationship and team dynamics. However, I can't help but feel a bit annoyed that we keep having these conversations without seeing significant changes. I need to reflect on my own communication style and how I can contribute to a more positive team environment.
